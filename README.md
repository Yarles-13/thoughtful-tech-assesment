Hello!

I’ve created a function called sort, which helps our robot friend determine how to handle different packages and get back to work on the field. 

To ensure the function works flawlessly, I’ve implemented test cases using Jest. Testing is essential because we want to make sure our robot is fully prepared for production


HOW TO RUN ...
a) git clone this repo
git clone <repo-url>

b) install dependencies
npm install 

c) run the test
npm test
